## What it does

- **Claude's take** — a single distilled sentence that captures the essence of the place
- **Sentiment score** with trend analysis (improving, stable, or declining)
- **Topic breakdown** — what people talk about most, ranked by mention frequency and sentiment
- **Vibe & tone** — emotional descriptors pulled from review language
- **Best for** — occasion tags with reviewer mention counts
- **When to go** — best and worst times based on review patterns
- **Heads up** — recurring complaints worth knowing before you visit
- **Insider tips** — hidden gems most people miss
- **Ask about this place** — follow-up questions answered by Claude in context
